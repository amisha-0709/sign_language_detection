![Sign Language Translation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Sign_language_ASL.png/800px-Sign_language_ASL.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a **real-time translation system for Indian Sign Language (ISL)**, converting hand gestures into both **text** and **speech** using a **webcam**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning (CNN)** models. It bridges communication gaps between the hearing and deaf communities by recognizing ISL gestures and instantly providing readable and audible outputs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Translate ISL hand gestures into real-time text and speech.
- Improve accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing.
- Provide a user-friendly, intuitive web interface.
- Ensure high accuracy, low latency, and scalability.
