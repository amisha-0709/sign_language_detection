# üß† Sign Language to Text and Speech Converter (Indian Sign Language)

![Sign Language Translation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Sign_language_ASL.png/800px-Sign_language_ASL.png)

## üìå Project Overview

This project provides a **real-time translation system for Indian Sign Language (ISL)**, converting hand gestures into both **text** and **speech** using a **webcam**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning (CNN)** models. It bridges communication gaps between the hearing and deaf communities by recognizing ISL gestures and instantly providing readable and audible outputs.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Translate ISL hand gestures into real-time text and speech.
- Improve accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing.
- Provide a user-friendly, intuitive web interface.
- Ensure high accuracy, low latency, and scalability.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Real-time webcam-based gesture recognition  
‚úÖ Text and voice output using speech synthesis  
‚úÖ Intuitive UI for ease of use  
‚úÖ Feedback and correction loop for users  
‚úÖ High accuracy using CNN models with Mediapipe landmarks

We have collected images of different signs of different angles for sign letter A to Z.

Now we get this landmark points and draw it in plain white background using opencv libray

Now we get this landmark points and draw it in plain white background using opencv library
-By doing this we tackle the situation of background and lightning conditions because the mediapipe labrary will give us landmark points in any background and mostly in any lightning conditions.
